# leftovers
a web app intended to help restaurants reduce food waste

while working as a chef in restaurants in the bay area, i often saw good food go to waste. produce that didn't have a place on one restaurant's menu, might be needed everyday at another restaurant. excess prepped food that didn't make it to a diner's table, could be an unhoused person's first meal of the week. the genesis of this idea started then - in the restaurant - "there's folks out there that need this food and there's gotta be a way to connect them to it"

leftovers is my attempt at doing that, connecting people with food that would otherwise turn into compost
