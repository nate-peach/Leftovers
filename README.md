# leftovers
a web app intended to help food businesses reduce food waste

while working as a chef in restaurants in the bay area, i often saw good food go to waste. produce that didn't have a place on one restaurant's menu, might be needed everyday at another restaurant. excess prepped food that didn't make it to a diner's table, could be an unhoused person's first meal of the week.

leftovers is my attempt at connecting people with good food that would otherwise turn into compost
